# Go Random File Generator

This is a simple Go program that generates a file of a specified size with random content. The program accepts a command-line argument that indicates the desired size of the file in MB and creates a file with a name based on the provided size.

## Usage

To compile the program, run the following command in a terminal:


To run the program and generate a 100 MB file named "file-100mb.txt", run the following command:


Replace "random-file-generator" with the name of the executable file generated by the `go build` command.

## How it works

The program uses Go's `math/rand` library to generate random content and the `os` library to create and write to the output file. The program writes the content of the file in blocks of 1024 bytes and uses the `rand.Read` function to generate random content for each block.
